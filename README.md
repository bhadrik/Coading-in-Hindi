# Coding-in-Hindi
Imagine what if Hindi become coding language? Here u can experience coding in Hindi.

# How to use
Translator.c is program that translat Hindi code to its equivalant C code.
Example.c is example input to this program.
Because of some limitition of identifiers in C, we can write only keywords & well known functions like printf & scanf in Hindi language.
File named Help.txt contain C's all 32 keyword's equivalant Hindi keyword.

# steps
Create program file using Hindi keywords like Example.c, as shown in Help.txt file [Must do: seperate Hindi keywords by space from any other token, else it will give u an error]
Compile Translator.c using "gcc -o Tran Translator.c" command
Pass Example.c file to Translator using "Tran.exe Example.c" it will generate OUT.c file which is traslated C file.
If translation sucessfull then it will ask for compilation also.
